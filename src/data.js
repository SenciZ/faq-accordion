    question: "How do I cancel my membership?",
    answer:
      "While we hate to see you cancel your membership, our cancellation process may vary from club to club, so the best way to begin the cancellation process is to contact your home club location to confirm the cancellation policy. For most locations, you can send a letter to your home club requesting to cancel, or you can stop by your home club and cancel in person. If you have other questions, please contact our Member Services department. Please note that the Member Services department is open Monday through Friday from 9 am - 6 pm, EST. They will respond to your inquiry as soon as possible.",
